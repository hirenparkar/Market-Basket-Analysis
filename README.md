The Power BI dashboard is designed with interactive visualizations to deliver comprehensive insights into customer purchasing behavior.

### Key Metrics
- **Total Transactions:** 7,835  
- **Product Count:** 170  

### Visual Components
1. **Basket Analysis Network**  
   - A network graph visualizing the relationships between frequently purchased products.  
   - Node size indicates the strength of product association (higher frequency = larger node).  
   - Example: Strong association between **Yogurt**, **Root Vegetables**, and **Whipped/Sour Cream**.

2. **Basket Analysis Map**

   - Helps identify product combinations with high purchase frequency and strong correlation.  
   - Example: **Root Vegetables** and **Other Vegetables** show high support and lift.

3. **Basket Analysis Details**  
   - A detailed table showcasing the most frequent product combinations with:  
     - **Support**: Frequency of product pair occurrence in all transactions.  
     - **Confidence**: Likelihood of purchasing the second product when the first is bought.  
     - **Lift**: Strength of association between two products.
